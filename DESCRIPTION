Description: ChromSCape - Chromatin landscape profiling for Single Cells - is a ready-to-launch user-friendly Shiny Application for the analysis of single-cell epigenomics datasets (scChIP-seq, scATAC-seq, scCUT&Tag, ...) from aligned data to differential analysis & gene set enrichment analysis. It is highly interactive, enables users to save their analysis and covers a wide range of analytical steps: QC, preprocessing, filtering, batch correction, dimensionality reduction, vizualisation, clustering, differential analysis and gene set analysis.
